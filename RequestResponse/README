This example requires JOLIE as of SVN revision 1106 (13 January 2010).

Services must be run concurrently in separate shells.
It is important that:
- every Station service is already running before Client starts;
- AdaptationManager is already running before starting the adaptation servers and/or the client.

The following is an example of a correct starting sequence:

jolie AdaptationManager.ol
jolie TrainStation.ol
jolie BusStation.ol
jolie TaxiStation.ol
jolie server1/AdaptationServer_1.ol
jolie server2/AdaptationServer_2.ol
jolie Client.ol
